# EasyEmoteMacOS ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/cool-project-green)
A very small-scale application that allows users to type emojis almost everywhere in a similar fashion as Discord and Slack. 

### Deployment Target: MacOS 10.15+

# Installation Instruction

### Download File:
Download and decompress the zip file from here: https://github.com/Jacky-He/EasyEmoteMacOS/releases/download/0.0/EasyEmoteMacOS.zip
### Install:
Double click on install.command in the decompressed folder to install EasyEmote.app.

The password it asks for is your computer password.

Note that you might need to go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy to allow processes to run since this is a third party input method for MacOS mostly for fun and utility.
### Start Using the Input Method:
1. Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources.

### Note that this is a subsequence search instead of a substring search. For example: "bt" is a subsequence of "bento" while "bt" is not a substring of "bento"
