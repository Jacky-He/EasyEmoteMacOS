# EasyEmoteMacOS
A very small-scale application that allows users to type emojis almost everywhere in a similar fashion as Discord and Slack. 

Deployment Target: MacOS 10.15+

Download Zip File: 

This is just a input method for fun. If you wish to try it out, download the zip file and double click install.command in the decompressed folder to install

Then you should be able to pick the emoji keyboard in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Method. You should see the emoji keyboard when you try to add an english keyboard.

The emojis are currently not subject to customization. Only those representable by Unicode are available. 

Further, the availability is subject to the environment in which the application runs (some emojis will appear as question marks)

Emoji data are retrieved from: https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
