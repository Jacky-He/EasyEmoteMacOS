 RankCentrality
 
 This class implements a mechanism to obtain absolute scores from 
 pair-wise comparisons for a population of individuals. It is based on the 
 paper "Iterative Ranking from Pair-wise Comparisons". It accepts a diagonal nxn matrix
 containing comparison scores for n individuals, and produces a vector (nx1 matrix)
 with values corresponding to each of the n items absolute score.
